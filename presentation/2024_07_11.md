## Area of intervention


the window as a medium portal linking interwine between the outside and inside and how it affects behavioral reponses.


+ Key visual (from your field research)
+ Optional second visual

## Research Question



## Research
Describe in a short paragraph (~1000 chars) the research that you have conducted around your core questions. Mentions your research methods: interviews, observations, questionnaires, et cætera. Illustrate each method with corresponding data, photo, sketches, audio, movies, etc. You can put a lot of elements here, but please curate the most illustrative materials.

## Insights
One, two, or three (max) insights from your research. Each insight described in one sentence. Example: "Pets can play the role of catalyst for resolving conflict in a couple".

## First ideas & prototypes

Last week, my landlord offered me the option to switch to a larger room with a roommate. However, when I saw her room, I realized it was poorly lit due to a small window, and I quickly chose to stay in my own. This made me reflect on how crucial natural light and outdoor connection are for my well-being. It got me thinking — **could a soft robot help recreate the sense of space and connection that a window provides in a dim, isolated room?**

**Can a soft robot be designed to facilitate a greater sense of openness and connection in spaces ?**

**How can the function of a window to offer an immersive experience that deepens our connection to both natural and artificial environments within indoor spaces?**

How can I feel like I am outside when i am inside ?

## Next Steps
In one sentence, describe what you will focus on next.

**How can a soft robot mimic the function of a window to offer an immersive experience that deepens our connection to both natural and artificial environments within indoor spaces?**

**What new habits, states, routines could this soft robot replicate or create?**

**How can the sensory feedback from a soft robot be designed to mimic the calming and engaging effects of natural light or external views through a window ? - especially when that connection is limited or obstructed?**

**Can a soft robot be designed to facilitate a greater sense of openness and connection in spaces ?**
